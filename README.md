This is a business card for myself. It delivers my instgram handle, phone number, and business email, so others can reach out to me if needed. Although I wanted to create a "professional" business card for my branding, this is just a learning experience. I've never worked with html or css before so this is a test. The monkey in my business card is similar to a signature of mine. I add my monkey into most artworks I've done. The background consist of some monkeys, coconuts, bananas, and cherries. The font I used is ropa sans and I like how the style is very simple and thin. My favorite part about the business card is how the monkey is holding the icons and that it's clickable. Now that I know how to make a decent business card, I will definitely try to create more designs.
